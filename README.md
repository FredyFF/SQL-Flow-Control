# SQL-Flow-Control

The BEGIN...END statement is used to create a statement block (or a bit similar to the code block {} in programming languages ​​such as Java, C++, C#, and so on, but BEGIN END does not limit the variable scope). But BEGIN...END must be used in control flow, which we will learn, for example: IF...ELSE, CASE and WHILE loops.
